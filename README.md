UWL-Teleport
============

This application was developed as a part of our project assignment for 'Advance Topics in Software Engineering' module of MSc. (Software Engineering).

This application is targeted for people associated to 'University of West London' (UWL), like students or staff of UWl. The main purpose of this application is to assist users to find the way to the various buildings/departments of this university, along with time-table information of university's shuttle bus service in various stops along its route.

This project included following team members:
- Diptesh Shrestha <diptesh.shrestha@gmail.com>
- M. Faisal Khilji <f_khilji2@yahoo.co.uk>
- Temitayo Fakunel <temi.fakunle@gmail.com>
- Santiago Presa <santiago.presa@gmail.com>

Version 1.0
-----------
- The time-table information of shuttle bus service is static data, based on assumed or expected time of the shuttle bus in each stop (based on information provided by the university).
- The feature regarding buildings and departments in each of them is work in progress and complete feature will be published in the version 2.0 of the application.
- The map feature has also been included. However, the current location of the user is not 100% accurate. This issue will be fixed in coming up version. 
- Locating the buildings in the map, images of the building to highlight the location of departments, and many other improvements can be expected in upcoming version of the UWL-Teleport.
- The future version will also try to resolve the flickering issue during page navigation.

Version 2.0
-----------
... coming soon.
